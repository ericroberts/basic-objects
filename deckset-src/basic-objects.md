# What is a primitive?

---

In computing, language primitives are the simplest elements available in a programming language. A primitive is the smallest 'unit of processing' available to a programmer of a particular machine, or can be an atomic element of an expression in a language.


<sup>â€” Wikipedia</sub>

---

# In Ruby

---

``` ruby
boolean = true
number  = 1
array   = [1,2,3,4,5]
range   = 1..3
hash    = { foo: :bar, baz: :qux }
```

---

# Obsession

---

"the state of being obsessed with someone or something."

---

# Really, google?

---

"an idea or thought that continually preoccupies<br />or intrudes on a person's mind."

---

# Primitive Obsession

# Every Array You Make


---

Primitive obsession is the practice of using primitives where specialized objects would be more appropriate. For example, using a string to represent a URL or Postal Code.

---

``` ruby
"N1H 7H8"
```

---

``` ruby
"N1H 7H8".valid?        #=> Uh... what?
```

---

``` ruby
class PostalCode < Struct.new(:code)
  def valid?
    # some code that ensures validity
  end
  
  def to_s
    code
  end
  
  def postal_district
    code[0]
  end
  
  def forward_sortation_area
    code[0..3]
  end
  
  def local_delivery_unit
    code[3..6]
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
postal_code = PostalCode.new("N1H 7H8")
postal_code.to_s                     #=> "N1H 7H8"
postal_code.postal_district          #=> "N"
postal_code.forward_sortation_area   #=> "N1H"
postal_code.local_delivery_unit      #=> "7H8"
```

---

## So, what about these percent things?

^ You may know that Rails adds some built in support for percents. Let's take a look

---

``` ruby
# Taken from ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper

number_to_percentage(100)                                        #=> 100.000%
number_to_percentage("98")                                       #=> 98.000%
number_to_percentage(100, precision: 0)                          #=> 100%
number_to_percentage(1000, delimiter: '.', separator: ',')       #=> 1.000,000%
number_to_percentage(302.24398923423, precision: 5)              #=> 302.24399%
number_to_percentage(1000, locale: :fr)                          #=> 1 000,000%
number_to_percentage("98a")                                      #=> 98a%
number_to_percentage(100, format: "%n  %")                       #=> 100  %

number_to_percentage("98a", raise: true)                         #=> InvalidNumberError
```

---

### This helps with formatting<br />but not much else.

---

# What else could you do?

---

``` ruby
# Something like...
50.percent(10)    #=> 5
```

^ This was a stack overflow question

---

## Monkey patching to the rescue!

---

``` ruby
class Numeric
  def percent(p)
    p.to_f / self.to_f * 100.0
  end
end

100.percent(10)     #=> 10

```

---

# Or not...

^ Monkey patching adds methods to your code that other people may not expect. Worse, you may monkey patch a method that actually exists, and really mess with someone's day. There's no reason to monkey patch when Ruby has such a great object system to work with.

---

## So, what do we do?

---

## We need an object

---

``` ruby
class Percent
  def initialize(value)
    @value = value
  end
end
```

^ the to_f call here is so when we divide by 100 we don't just get 0. It's likely you'll pass an integer, and it won't use any decimal places.

---

## What should it do?

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
percent.value   #=> 50.0
percent.to_s    #=> '50%'
percent.to_f    #=> 0.5
percent == 50   #=> false
percent == 0.5  #=> true
```
---

``` ruby
attr_reader :value
```

---

``` ruby
def to_s
  '%g%%' % value
end

percent = Percent.new(50)
percent.to_s #=> "50%"
```

---

``` ruby
def to_f
  value/100
end

percent = Percent.new(85)
percent.to_f #=> 0
```

---

# Wait, what?

---

``` ruby
85/100   = 0
85.0/100 = 0.85
```

---

``` ruby
def initialize(value)
  @value = value.to_f
end

percent = Percent.new(85)
percent.to_f #=> 0.85
```

---

``` ruby
def == other
  (other.class == class && other.value == value) ||
    other == to_f
end

Percent.new(20) == Percent.new(20)    #=> true
Percent.new(20) == 0.2                #=> true
```

---

``` ruby
def eql? other
  self == other
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
percent.value   #=> 50.0
percent.to_s    #=> '50%'
percent.to_f    #=> 0.5
percent == 50   #=> false
percent == 0.5  #=> true
```

---

``` ruby
bigger = Percent.new(90)
smaller = Percent.new(10)

bigger > smaller  #=> true
smaller < bigger  #=> true
```
---

``` ruby
def <=> other
  to_f <=> other.to_f
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(10)
percent + percent   #=> Percent.new(20)
percent - percent   #=> Percent.new(0)
percent * percent   #=> Percent.new(1)
percent / percent   #=> 1
```

---

``` ruby
def + other
  self.class.new(value + other.value)
end

percent = Percent.new(10)
percent + percent #=> Percent.new(20)
```

---

``` ruby
def - other
  self.class.new(value - other.value)
end

percent = Percent.new(10)
percent - percent #=> Percent.new(0)
```

---

``` ruby
def * other
  self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
end

percent = Percent.new(10)
percent * percent #=> Percent.new(1)
```

---

``` ruby
def / other
  self.class.new(value / other.value)
end

percent = Percent.new(10)
percent / percent #=> 1
```

---

## OK, but that's not all that interesting

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
percent + 10    #=> Percent.new(60)
percent - 10    #=> Percent.new(40)
percent * 10    #=> Percent.new(500)
percent / 10    #=> Percent.new(5)
```
---

## We're going to focus on just one method for now

---

``` ruby
def * other
  case other
  when Percent
    self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
  when Numeric
    self.class.new(value * other)
  end
end

percent = Percent.new(50)
percent * percent #=> Percent.new(25)
percent * 10      #=> Percent.new(500)
```

---

## What about the other way around?

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
10 + percent    #=> 15
10 - percent    #=> 5
10 * percent    #=> 5
10 / percent    #=> 20
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
10 * percent    #=> 5

```

---

## Now things start to get interesting

---

# #coerce

^ Coerce is used when the operation you want to perform on two objects is not compatible. You can call coerce on the target in order to receive back two objects that are compatible.

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
1 * percent
```

---

## Any guesses as to<br />what happens here?

---

``` ruby
1 * percent

# percent will receive the coerce message
# with the number we are trying to multiply by

percent.coerce(1)
```

---

```
TypeError: Percent can't be coerced into Fixnum
```

^ The expectation from the Numeric class is that percent.coerce will return two objects, which it can then perform the same operation on, but be successful this time.

^ Where an operation on two objects is incompatible, coerce will return two objects where that operation is compatible.

---

``` ruby
class Percent
  def coerce other
    [other, to_f]
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)

10 * percent
percent.coerce(1)  #=> [10, 0.5]
10 * 0.5            #=> 5
```

---

# Let's review...

---

``` ruby
class Percent
  [...]

  def * other
    case other
    when Percent
      self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
    when Numeric
      self.class.new(value * other)
    end
  end
  
  def coerce other
    [other, to_f]
  end
end
```

---

# What if "other" is not Numeric?

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
money = Money.new(100)

# What we want to happen
percent * money  #=> Money.new(50)
```

---

``` ruby
# What actually happens
percent * money  #=> nil
```

---

``` ruby
def * other
  case other
  when Percent
    self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
  when Numeric
    self.class.new(value * other)
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
def * other
  case other
  when Percent
    self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
  when Numeric
    self.class.new(value * other)
  when Money
    other * to_f
  end
end
```

---

## #coerce to the rescue

---

``` ruby
def * other
  if other.is_a? Percent
    self.class.new(to_f * other.value)
  elsif other.respond_to? :coerce
    a, b = other.coerce(self)
    a * b
  else
    raise TypeError, "#{other.class} can't be coerced into Percent."
  end
end
```
---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
money = Money.new(100)

percent * money
```

---

``` ruby
percent * money
money.coerce(percent)

# Money receive :coerce with the percent,
# and returns the same things in opposite order
[money, percent]

# Then we try the operation again
money * percent
percent.coerce(money)

# Now, percent receives coerce, with money,
# and returns two more things, this time with 
# the percent changed to float
[money, float]

# Finally, we can perform this operation
# without more coercion
money * float

Money.new(100) * 0.5  #=> Money.new(50)
```

---

``` ruby
class Money
  def coerce(other)
    [self, other]
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent * money
money.coerce(percent)

# Money receive :coerce with the percent,
# and returns the same things in opposite order
[money, percent]

# Then we try the operation again
money * percent
percent.coerce(money)

# Now, percent receives coerce, with money,
# and returns two more things, this time with 
# the percent changed to float
[money, float]

# Finally, we can perform this operation
# without more coercion
money * float

Money.new(100) * 0.5  #=> Money.new(50)
```

---

``` ruby
class Percent
  def coerce other
    [other, to_f]
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent * money
money.coerce(percent)

# Money receive :coerce with the percent,
# and returns the same things in opposite order
[money, percent]

# Then we try the operation again
money * percent
percent.coerce(money)

# Now, percent receives coerce, with money,
# and returns two more things, this time with 
# the percent changed to float
[money, float]

# Finally, we can perform this operation
# without more coercion
money * float

Money.new(100) * 0.5  #=> Money.new(50)
```

---

### Percent knows nothing about Money, and Money knows nothing about percent, but it all works!

^ To me, this feels pretty much like magic.

---

## More complicated coercions

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
10 + percent    #=> 15
10 - percent    #=> 5
10 * percent    #=> 5
10 / percent    #=> 20
```
---

``` ruby
# Our current coerce method
def coerce other
  [other, to_f]
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)

# expected
10 + percent    #=> 15

#actual
10 + percent    #=> 10.5
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)
10 + percent

# percent receives coerce, and returns itself
# as a float in the second spot
percent.coerce(10)    #=> [10, 0.5]

# Now it adds those two together
10 + 0.5              #=> 10.5
```

---

``` ruby
# But it works as expected for multiplication!

percent = Percent.new(50)
10 * percent

percent.coerce(10)    #=> [10, 0.5]
10 * 0.5              #=> 5
```

---

## Coerce doesn't tell us what method was called, so what do we do?

---

# Investigate the call stack!

```

---

## Doesn't really feel right though, does it?

^ What do we know?
^ We don't know what method triggered the call to coerce, but it's about to get used again, and this time we can be in control.
^ Let's not forget that everything is an object!

---

``` ruby
10.plus(percent)
percent.coerce(10)     #=> [something, something_else]
something.plus(something_else)
```
---

## If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably Ruby

---

## What we need is an object that responds to #Plus

---

``` ruby
def coerce other
  [CoercedPercent.new(self), other]
end

```

---

``` ruby
class CoercedPercent
  attr_reader :percent

  def initialize(percent)
    @percent = percent
  end
  
  def * other
    other * percent.to_f
  end
  
  def + other
    other + self * other
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
percent = Percent.new(50)

# Multiplication
10 * percent
percent.coerce(10)                  #=> [CoercedPercent.new(percent), 10]
CoercedPercent.new(percent) * 10    #=> 5

# Addition
10 + percent
percent.coerce(10)                  #=> [CoercedPercent.new(percent), 10]
CoercedPercent.new(percent) + 10    #=> 15
```

---

``` ruby
# We can do the same thing for division and subtraction

class CoercedPercent
  [...]
  
  def / other
    other / percent.to_f
  end
  
  def - other
    other - self * other
  end
end
```

---

## Now, let's clean<br />some things up

---

## Bring on the monkey patching!

---

``` ruby
module Percentable
  module Numeric
    def to_percent
      Percentable::Percent.new(self)
    end
  end
end

class Numeric
  include Percentable::Numeric
end

10.to_percent    #=> Percent.new(10)
```

^ If you are going to monkey patch, do it this way. It inserts this in the inheritance tree, so you can see where it came from instead of just reopening the class and adding the method.

---

## What about Rails?

---

``` ruby
module Percentable
  module Percentize
    def percentize *args
      options = args.pop if args.last.is_a? Hash

      args.each do |method_name|
        define_method(method_name) do |args=[]|
          Percent.new(super(*args) || options[:default])
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

---

``` ruby
class Thingamajig < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Percentable::Percentize

  percentize :taxes, default: 10
end

t = Thingamajig.new(taxes: 20)
t.taxes    #=> Percent.new(20)

```
